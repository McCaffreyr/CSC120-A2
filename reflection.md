What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Looking at the procedural code and copying what can overlap such as error messages was helpful. I haven't used Classes in a while and had a bit of trouble remembering how to use them, but going to office hours was very helpful! I need to remember to anchor the attributes that I want to refer to with "self.". I also struggled a bit to figure out submitting it to Github/Gradescope because this is my first time doing that, but went to TA hours to figure that out. I would definitly recommend asking for help. Overall I really enjoyed this assignment, and getting back into coding.
